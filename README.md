# Blockchain-based decentralized voting application

This is a demonstration of a Blockchain based authentication and decentralized e-Voting process. In this project login information are not stored in a database, but the hash resulting from login data is stored on a smart contract[Authentication].
Another solidity contract[Election] is used for storing the electors as candidates and the voting process is taken care by Admin. At the end of the voting period the results are declared and winning candidate then claims  1 Ether as prize money[unlocked from the Smart Contract].
